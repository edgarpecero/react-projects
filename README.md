# React Projects

This repository contains a collection of React projects developed using TypeScript. Each project showcases different libraries, tools, and techniques to build modern web applications. More projects will be added in the future!

## Projects

### 0. utils
A collection of reusable utility functions designed to streamline common operations across applications. The utils file includes:
- **Formatting Helpers**: Functions for formatting dates, prices, and percentages.
- **Data Manipulation**: Utilities for merging, filtering, and summing values.
- **React-Specific Helpers**: Accessibility props and React component utilities.
- **Miscellaneous**: Enum conversions, permissions checks, and other helper functions.

This utils file is shared across projects to ensure consistency and reduce redundant code.

- **Task Creation**: Users can create tasks by entering a title and description.
- **Drag and Drop**: Move tasks between columns with ease.

### 2. react-flow-and-mui-charts
An interactive UI application built with React Flow and MUI Charts. Features include:
- **Dynamic Diagrams**: Create, edit, and visualize workflows using React Flow.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays interactive charts and graphs with MUI Chart.
- **Customizable Nodes**: Easily add and modify nodes in diagrams.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Ensures type safety and scalability.

## Future Plans
- Expand the collection with more React TypeScript projects.
- Explore additional libraries and features for modern UI/UX development.

Feel free to explore the projects and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!
